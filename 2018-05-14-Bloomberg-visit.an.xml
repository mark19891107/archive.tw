        <speech by="#jodi-schneider">
          <p>Thank you for taking the time to see us. I am based in Hong Kong, as Samson probably told you. I am just here for a friend's wedding party actually. She is American. She's moving back from Hong Kong. She's Taiwanese American, and her family is here, including our 97-year-old grandfather who we all adopted. He actually adopted all of us [laughs] this weekend.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#jodi-schneider">
          <p>Anyway, she wanted to have...and her mother said, "You better have your Asian wedding before you go back to the States," since she has so many of her relatives here. I happen to have been in town for the weekend and felt what an opportunity to talk to you. Great.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>How can I help...?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#samson-ellis">
          <p>I'm really based here in Taipei. We're always looking for interesting, new stories to do. I'm not sure if you feel this, too. Quite a lot of the time, foreign media, they focus quite a lot on a few very small topics, a narrow range of topics when it comes to Taiwan. Cross-strait relations, and...</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>...our food. [laughs]</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#samson-ellis">
          <p>Food and technology are the big ones, the important stories. One of the things we always feel we have to do is broaden our outlook a little bit and find new and interesting stories. I think your project here is incredibly interesting. It's potentially changing government and the way government does business and how transparent government is.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#samson-ellis">
          <p>That's a really interesting topic for all governments right now. Globally, this is interesting. I don't know if you could tell us a little bit more about what you're doing, any recent successes you have or the direction it's going.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>My main mandate, so to speak, is open government at the government side, and social innovation at the civil society side. Those two are two sides at the same coin. This innovation plan that we have is essentially not top down at all. We are working "with" innovators, not working "for" innovators.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>This is epitomized by a social innovation lab. It's in the TAF cultural park, near the Jianguo flower market. I don't know whether you know...</p>

          <p>I was amazed. I was like, "I want this in Hong Kong. I could go get lovely flowers for not a lot of money." Yeah, it's lovely.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>That's great. My residence, the minister's dormitory, is just next to the Jianguo flower market. For me, it's just 10 minutes' walk from one end of Jianguo flower to the other end of Jianguo flower market, where it borders the Jianguo jade market.</p>

        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>Awesome. On the other side of the Jianguo jade market is the TAF, which stand for the Taiwan Air Force, the TAF cultural park. In the cultural park, on the other end of the TAF, is the social innovation lab.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>I know that you probably had to walk all the way there, so I will show you a photo. This is how it looks like. It's quite interesting in how the space itself was created, as well as the business we conduct in this space.</p>

        <speech by="#jodi-schneider">
          <p>How big, you said?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>It's two buildings. The whole TAF is, of course, very large. This is like one-tenth or some of the TAF. During my office hours, which is every Wednesday from 10:00 AM to 10:00 PM, I am just there for anyone to approach.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>As long as they are OK for the transcript to be published, anyone can meet me. Every other Tuesday, I tour around Taiwan to meet with the regional, rural indigenous social innovators. In the TAF, there is 12 different ministries' people.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>Using projectors, telepresence, 360 live stream, and other assorted technologies, I am like an investigative journalist. [laughs] I go into places. Then the different ministries, they see through my eyes the local innovators. When they raise issues, they are there to respond immediately.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>This is like a connected rooms, connected space. We've been touring around Taiwan like this for, I don't know, 20 times or so now. I return to one spot every two months. By that two months, all the issues that are raised are usually all resolved. Otherwise, I don't know what otherwise, because it's always resolved. [laughs] It is a way to publish a real-time conversation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>I think this is important because while I always hold that Wednesday office hour open to anyone, I find that it's usually people living close to Taipei, or who live close to a high-speed rail station that makes use of my time this way.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#samson-ellis">
          <p>You log where people are from, or you ask them as part of the conversation, or do you log, "OK, where are you from? Where do you live?"</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>Exactly, exactly. It's all published as a transcript two weeks at least at latest after each conversation. When I, for example, go to Taichung, the whole conversation becomes the social object for the local people to connect with when I visit the next site two weeks afterwards and then continue the dialogue.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>I think this is an interesting way of gathering the real-time feedback from people. Through this kind of tour, so that's Tuesday. Wednesday, I'm here in the office hour. Tuesday, I tour around Taiwan. Friday, we have what we call collaboration workshops, which is usually with people who raised this kind of e-petition.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>This is how we gather around one large room in the TAF and to talk about any issue that is part of the e-petition platform that is usually cross-ministry that couldn't be solved by any single ministry. Then we use this network of participation officers which every ministry has a dedicated team now.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>Any larger ministries, even third-level agencies now have participation officers. Just like we get officers who talk to journalists, just like the parliamentary officers who talk to the MPs, participation officers are people who talk to stakeholders such as this person here who last May raised a petition that says, "You know, on Mac, Linux and tablets the income tax form software is explosively hostile."</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>They get quite a following. [laughs] Then after 48 hours, the [non-English speech] , the Ministry of Finance participation officer is posted publicly online saying that whoever complained about our income tax filing software are invited to co-creation workshops this Friday or next Friday.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>This is very interesting because whereas before about 80 percent of people online on e-petition forum are very negative, only less than 20 percent said, "I use Windows and I feel pretty good." [laughs] Nobody cared about it. [laughs] As soon as the invitation was posted, it's reversed. 80 percent of the people offer very constructive criticism.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>Only 20 percent or so of people are still criticizing the Ministry of Finance. The thing is that we basically used all the issues raised by these online forums and used this kind of Post-It Notes to identify the actual pain points during the income tax filing experience.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>Then, we held four co-creation workshops afterwards, after this livestream one so that the vendors, the contractors, facilitators, and so on all worked with people. It turns out that the people who complained the loudest are actually experts. They're actually expert designers, expert IT people and so on.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>They have the reason to say, "You know, we know more than the government about, [laughs] about how to make such a software." This May, just this month, so the old system became revamped by the co-creation workshop into the new system. The new system gets a very positive review.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>This, I think the highlight is not in this software. If we spend enough money, we can eventually get this, [laughs] but in the co-creation process where we get applicants from thousands of people who feel that they have a say and participated in this creation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>Some IT experts during the co-creation, they pointed out that we can use cloud service and so on to reduce the operation costs. This project is actually operating on a negative budget, [laughs] saved a lot of money. We use a fraction of it to run the creation workshops.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#samson-ellis">
          <p>It's better and cheaper?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>It is better and cheaper. We can't get this with the government ministries alone. It changes the dynamic seen from the government ministries. Whereas before they see people who complain on the Internet as only causing trouble, a waste of their time, a lot of noise, using this structured way of incorporating their recommendations we held about 30 cooperation workshops now.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>More than half the time it results in something that is better and cheaper for the ministry, which is a pretty good success rate. That's an example.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#samson-ellis">
          <p>What kind of issues do people usually bring up with you when you're there on Wednesdays? Is it just all kinds of complaints directed toward the government or are there certain kinds of complaints that come up often?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>There's a trick. Instead of being an arbiter that directly solves a problem my philosophy is that we empower the problem solvers to solve their problem. The idea is that we find out which of their issues are caused by the government and the government can relax their regulations a lot.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>Instead of viewing ourselves as the arbiter between different interests, we see ourselves more as a space. Then we ask the questions, such as, "What are the common values that you can discover even though your positions differ? Based on these kinds of values, are there solutions that work for everyone?"</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>Instead of being the arbiter that sides with one side or the other side, this is a rolling cycle of discovery. When people come to me and say they want to work on long-term care using blockchain or they're advocates for universal basic income...</p>
        </speech>
        <narrative>
          <p>
            <i>（laughter）</i>
          </p>
        </narrative>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>There's many, many very interesting social innovators who come to me, because our conversation is posted online, so it is actually a rolling process. People will say, "I discovered that two weeks ago during your office hour you talked with this innovator and I think I can help by offering this technology," and things like that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>Basically, I'm like a catalyst that connect those social innovators without actually becoming a part of their cause, because I'm a public servant.</p>
        </speech>
        <narrative>
          <p>
            <i>（laughter）</i>
          </p>
        </narrative>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>I offer mostly advice. If they run counter to the current regulations I work with the ministries people to see if we can relax the regulations and reinterpret the regulations so that they can operate legally.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>We are very blessed, because currently in Taiwan the National Development Council has an idea that anything that is not explicitly forbidden by law should be allowed, even though there were interpretations to the contrary, those must be relaxed. They were using the KPIs as, "How many interpretations has each ministry relaxed?" They review it every other week.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>This is very fortunate because then we can talk to the social innovators, find if their mission aligned with the ministry's mission, because most of the ministries are charities anyway so they have an annual mission. [laughs] If they align, these ministries are much more inclined to relax their regulations for them.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>Even if actually there is a law that currently forbids, for example, blockchain based banking and AI banking, or whatever, we have sandbox law now.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>The Fintech Sandbox law, which is a law currently in effect, says that anyone can challenge the existing law to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Finance, even though it's currently illegal, as long as there's a chance of being a social good they're given 6 months to 12 months of experimentation during which they can break the law.</p>
        </speech>
        <narrative>
          <p>
            <i>（laughter）</i>
          </p>
        </narrative>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>They can also point to any regulation, not necessarily the Ministry of Finance, they can point to any regulation and say, "I want to break this regulation from PDIS," "I want to break this regulation from Ministry of Transportation and Communication." As long as there's a multi-stakeholder consensus of the experimentation process, the regulation must change according to this social experiment in fact.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>Of course, two caveats. First is that there are somethings that are a red line that we cannot cross. You can't say, "I want to experiment with money laundering for six months." You can't say, "I want to experiment with funding the terrorists for seven months." That probably doesn't work.</p>
        </speech>
        <narrative>
          <p>
            <i>（laughter）</i>
          </p>
        </narrative>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>Those experiments are not to be started, but almost everything is fair game. Sometimes at the end of the experimentation there's some law change required rather than regulation. For regulation, we can just announce for 60 days and have a conversation and be done with it, but for law change it requires the Parliament.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>In the Fintech Sandbox, which is unique in the world, we allowed experiment to be extended up to three years waiting for the law to change. Once the law changes everybody else can enter this market. Now we have the Fintech Sandbox. Next, we are handing to the legislation the AI Mobility Sandbox which is for self-driving vehicles. They could be on the road, in the air, on the sea, that's the AI Mobility Sandbox.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>The third one that we're working on at the moment is the Regional Sandbox, which is a general-purpose sandbox. They must be initiated by a regional, like county government that want to solve their particular social need. There again, they get to challenge the Central Government's laws and regulations. Even the law itself is subject to disruption thorugh the sandbox law.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#samson-ellis">
          <p>It sounds incredible.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#jodi-schneider">
          <p>When you say social innovation, it sounds like you're talking writ large, but there's a technology component to most of the things you've talked about.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#jodi-schneider">
          <p>Does there need to be in all the cases?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>No, not at all. It could be a process innovation, it could be an idea innovation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#jodi-schneider">
          <p>Can you give an example?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>Yeah. It could just be adding a name. One of the largest social enterprises in Taiwan, the Children Are Us Foundation, or CAREUS Foundation, they use the Chinese name XÇ hÄn er. XÇ hÄn er is in itself a name is a social innovation because it stands for, "Joyful, Honest, Children." Whereas this group of people were previously called clinically people with Down syndrome or just morons.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>By using XÇ hÄn er, Joyful, Honest, Children as the moniker, it changes the social relationship between these people and the society. For example, the soccer playing field in the social innovation lab, that is a creation by the Joyful, Honest Children. [laughs] I can't do that. They are very artistically inclined.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>There's multiple efforts, like the bakery, preparing of frozen foods, or a lot of artful creation projects that involves the Joyful, Honest, Children as the service providers rather than the service receivers. There's social enterprise in Taiwan that is systematically working with for the first-time street dealers on wheelchairs and re-imagine their work into a service provider instead of a service receiver.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>I think this is somewhere. Here, right. As you can see they used to look like this, but now with a designer firm...The picture on the right is also a creation of Joyful, Honest, Children...</p>
        </speech>
        <narrative>
          <p>

          </p>
        </narrative>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>...and so they re-imagined their wheelchair and connect to social enterprises that design ergonomic mobile stations, so now they can service WiFi hot spots, phone charging stations, and dealing not just with tissue papers or chewing gums, but instead fair trade tea, coffee or some other ways. The crowdsourcing and crowdfunding campaign was a huge success.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>What I'm trying to say is that it's not just one single intervention. The social enterprises we're saying are now basically connecting to the supply chain, so that in this project, for example, the supply chain includes people who train the wheelchair people on more rich interactions, and that's one social enterprise.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>There's people who work on the wheelchair itself into mobile station and that's technological, but there's also people who work on, for example, Taipei City which bills itself as a fair-trade city and therefore has a lot of fair-trade goods, some from the indigenous and some from the overseas, and for these mobile stations to carry.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>Each project like this connects literally dozens of stakeholders and each of them brings on innovation and only maybe half of them are technological in nature.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#jodi-schneider">
          <p>Much of this seems to be focused on technology, but also in a broader sense of, as you keep talking about, innovation. It seems like what you had done in the private public sector is driving what's happening in the public sector.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>It is.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#jodi-schneider">
          <p>How has that been received both by the private sector and the public sector?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>I think the unique value composition of social entrepreneurship is that it is at once private sector and civil society, so it's the second end of the sector merged into one. I publicly announced myself as a conservative anarchist. The anarchist one means that I wish or I strive so that people see government as a useful solution.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>Most of the things actually the private sector handles they can do by their own, so by systematically using radical transparency letting everybody know how the government is doing their business, people become empowered saying, "OK, but these things you can do as well."</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>That is one effect and I think that part is very well received. The conservative part of me says, "However, I will not order any ministry or any public servant to do things my way." I only work with people who voluntarily come to me. If the Ministry of Defense, or whatever, who doesn't want to use radical transparency or cooperation, I don't force them to.</p>

          <p>Exactly, so I'm not like a radical revolutionary in that way. I only work with people. In fact, in Taiwan, for example, the air pollution measurement, the Air Box Project, these are more than 2,000 air pollution measurements, not very precise, but not at all funded or endorsed by the government.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>This kind of grassroots is very special in Asia, because in most Asian countries, even "democratic" ones, these kinds of projects they don't get to grow to 2,000 people or more than that.</p>

          <p>This is very simply people who put cheap PM2.5, NOx, or whatever sensors in their house, in their balcony, in their schools. Some primary schools use that as an education tool to raise environmental awareness.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>The Academia Sinica people provide this online platform for all those IOP sensors to connect to so that they can do predictions. Not very accurate, I would say, but the predictions of how and why the air pollutions come.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>All this is not at all related to the state environmental commission agency, the PA Sensor Network, which although they're expanding it, so that they will eventually have multiple thousands of sensors as long as they're not in your home or in your school it's not really relevant to the people, because people really want to know how the air is like here instead of like 5 kilometers away or 10 kilometers away.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>This threatens actually the legitimacy of the government network. We have a lot of professors who have competing air pollution prediction frameworks and they all use a subset of data. Once the data is different and the algorithm is different you can't really do science [laughs] there's basically factions where people follow.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>In Taiwan, we allocated over four years about five billion Taiwan dollars to enhance this network instead of saying that they're illegitimate, we're embracing this technology, so that there's two prongs for us that we are using the national supercomputing center.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>We aggregate all the different data the civil society contributed, the private sector contributed and government on, not just air quality, but also water aspect prediction and during disaster, the roads are broken or whatever, disaster information, into one single platform.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>All the different professors and scholars, they don't have to download partial data they can just upload their code, their algorithm for prediction on the same database platform, so that we can compare it next to each other and actually do science this way.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>The other thing is the ITRI, the Research Institute for Industrial Technology, we also asked them to produce really cheap but still much more accurate PM2.5 sensors so that these people can upgrade to a higher position.</p>

        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>Well, it's quantify and qualify. The quantify part we can measure quite easily, because it's an online platform. For instance, we can measure whether people propose more positions, whether there are more positions that result in actionable policies.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>Also, the very important thing is whether the ministries themselves feel comfortable publishing their projects on the online platform for everybody to comment on as social objects.

        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>Just a very recent addition, just last month is what we call the National Budget Visualization Platform, so that you can see how each ministry spends on their relative budgets. All of the more than 1,200 projects managed by the ministries themselves are also online for people to comment on and for people to see how it's spending their money, how much procurement or research people are doing.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>I think they see this as a tremendous step at the ministries' part to be willing to trust the citizen to use this public data which previously was only visible to the auditing agency, the national auditing council. Especially, the people who are against policies, they trust people to use this information wisely instead of generating disinformation, or whatever.</p>

          <p>It took us more than a year to convince the participating offices of all ministries.

There's no trolls, there's no interruptions to the way that we work.</p>

          <p>Last time in Barcelona, they are very eager to learn from this process. There is another platform called vTaiwan, which maybe they have already heard some cases about it on the Internet, because vTaiwan we basically use label as V, starting with a V, so now also for Japan they have a vJapan and vNYC in New York City.</p>

        <speech by="#avross-hsiao">
          <p>We have a vTaiwan in this process to facilitate deliberation among public sectors, private sectors and all other stakeholders, the more the better. That process might be a little different from e-petition platform.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#avross-hsiao">
          <p>From my own personal view, vTaiwan is a process that lets the private sectors and public sectors on an equal relationship, so they can join a meeting face to face and discuss about any kinds of issues equally. E-petition platform, it's from inside the government and they invite stakeholders from the outside government into the public sector, and to learn from the so-called wisdom of the crowd. For vTaiwan, it's a process that's more focused on the collaboration among, we suppose, community volunteers and the public sectors.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#avross-hsiao">
          <p>Also, it's sometimes a little bit like community oriented, is because we hold a meeting, we have a call every Wednesday so we let the volunteers and contributors to figure out or like brainstorming in what they are interested. They are empowered to propose any kinds of issues they are concerned about. E-petition platform there is a threshold of 5,000 people?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>There's a co-determined process there.

In vTaiwan the process itself is determined by the stakeholders and the government people are invited into the vTaiwan space, so it's...</p>

          <p>That's right. The e-petition process is a regulation. We have a regulation for the participation officers and for e-petition, but for the moment there is no regulation for vTaiwan. It is every case has its own process.</p>

          <p>I think Taiwan is unique because during the occupy in 2014, this demonstration not as a protest but demonstration as a demo of how things could because we've engaged half-a-million people on the street and many more people online, "We have the crowd, can we yield some intelligence out of the crowd?"</p>

          <p>Many of the things that are shown here are I would say, diluted [laughs] forms of direct democracy that's demonstrated during the Sunflower Movement. We also exported some of the technology to the Umbrella Movement and so there's a longer field test there also. Unlike many occupies in the world, Taiwan's Sunflower occupy is a very rare one that see people's ideas converge rather than diverge over time.</p>

          <p>For example, how the share is distributed, the special voting stock and how important things are to be conducted, and how fast the registration should be, so the government is managing less and relying on transparency and public auditing more.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>That's the basic idea. It enables start-ups to much more easily get the kind of funding structure that they need. There actually is a vTaiwan case that passed a version of this called, Closely Held Corporations, but it's limited to 50 people, so 50 shareholders. Now we're taking most of the closely held law and expanding it to any non-publicly listed company, which would enable a new class of companies.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>For example, personally I care about companies that have a triple bottom line that is to not just profit but also social and economic benefits. Now with the new company law they can have a company charter that lists explicitly the social and environmental needs.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>The government will publish the charter as open data with the company's consent. They will be able to raise funds all the way to Series A, but still retain control the social, economic, environmental purpose using special shares and veto shares and things like that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>All of these were not possible using the old company law. The old company law even said, "The company exists to earn a profit," and we even have to have the Minister of Economic Affairs to do an interpretation saying that for the profit is not necessarily just for profit. It's a stretch of the interpretation. [laughs]</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>Now we're changing clause one of the company law to say, "The company may also declare additional bottom lines that are equally important as the for-profit motive," and things like that, so there's quite a few changes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#samson-ellis">
          <p>That's absolutely fascinating. One thing on the transparency side, talking about companies, a lot of companies in Taiwan are very untransparent, and it's a constant struggle for us when we...</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#samson-ellis">
          <p>One of the main things we have to do is we have to write about company earnings, financial results, and just trying to get them to say, "OK, we are going to announce them at this time, on this date," absolutely impossible.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>Yeah, it is.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#samson-ellis">
          <p>These are publicly listed companies. There's a certain level of transparency they're supposed to have, but you try and call people and, they absolutely won't talk to you. Like company spokesmen, this position, you can never get a hold of these [laughs] people. There's a very guarded but also very antagonistic attitude to public accountability...</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>Some of these are in line with independent board members; and now with the new company law, also so-called corporate secretary, that this chief of compliance. There's many sections, I think, inspired by the US, Hong Kong or UK law that try to improve this particular regard. I'll be honest and say these are the sections that are meeting the most resistance.</p>

        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>I think it's mostly managed by the Ministry of Justice. During the company law conversation, of course, I attended part of the Ministry of Economy and Ministry of Justice debate [laughs] on these particular aspects. I think they eventually settled on a degree of revelation of the real benefactors of company transactions and things like that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>That's all required by the international AML community. That's one of the hotly debated issues in the legislation right now, like where do we put the dial. I think all this will be settled in a few weeks. [laughs]</p>

          <p>It is their argument. The main response to that, actually, during our public hearings is that what we're going to work is ICP tools that makes it simpler for them to reveal the information.</p>

        <speech by="#audrey-tang">
          <p>Maybe we can re-purpose part of the text file information for this purpose. Maybe we can re-purpose some Ministry of Economy registration for this purpose and so on that we lower the cost of very small enterprises for compliance by piggy-backing on the thing that I have to do anyway. That's our main response so far. It's being lukewarmly received...</p>
